# web-crawling
This crawler was intended for scraping articles from known news websites, but can be expanded to other territories.
It basiclly searches all hrefs in a given URL address, downloads them locally, and allows a string to be searched in them.
The repository of saved articles can then be searched offline and be updated without the need to redownload already downloaded articles in every run.
